 ## Zhenghao Sun, Shu Yang, Shenyou Fan, Quan Pham

 ### 1.Introduction
With the rapid development of computer technology and the rise of data learning, all aspects of our daily lives are becoming inseparable from all kinds of
data. Personalized recommendation systems make use of millions of data, allowing computers to learn the relationships between seemingly unrelated data and
gain insight into our preferences and choices. In this paper, we will investigate and implement our own recommendation system using reinforcement learning
methods such as Q-learing, Deep Q Network (DQN), and Actor Critic. We will also write reward functions for different algorithms with their characteristics
and compare the impact of different reward functions on different methods.
